# Secured Academic Transcript System Leveraging Blockchain and AI

## Objective
To design and develop a decentralized Academic Transcript Management System using blockchain for enhanced security and artificial intelligence (AI) for fast and secure access.

## Simulation Type
Blockchain Simulation / Distributed Systems Simulation

## Types of Dataset
1. Academic transcript data
2. university records

## Possible Sources for Dataset
1. Institutional data (simulated)
2. Blockchain data

## Dataset URLs
1. - (Custom-simulated datasets required for transcripts and security features)

## Setup Instructions
1. 1. Install Hyperledger Fabric or Ethereum for blockchain implementation
2. 2. Install AI libraries (TensorFlow, PyTorch) for anomaly detection and data analysis
3. 3. Set up blockchain nodes and deploy smart contracts for transcript validation and storage
4. 4. Create student records and simulate the process of document verification across institutions

## Implementation Guide
1. 1. Implement blockchain ledger for storing and transmitting academic transcripts
2. 2. Use AI algorithms for anomaly detection in transcripts (detecting forgeries)
3. 3. Simulate transcript request and approval workflow, including interactions between universities and foreign institutions
4. 4. Track delivery times and security features such as encryption and integrity verification
5. 5. Visualise transaction logs and transcript status updates in real time

## Expected Output(s)
1. Simulated blockchain transaction logs; system speed and security performance metrics; anomaly detection accuracy for forged transcripts

## Background Studies
### Blockchain Technology
A decentralized ledger system that ensures the security, transparency, and integrity of data. It can be used to store academic records securely, allowing for tamper-proof transmission between institutions.

### Smart Contracts
Self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into lines of code. Used here for automating the transcript verification process.

### AI for Anomaly Detection
Artificial intelligence techniques that analyze student transcripts to detect inconsistencies or forged records based on historical data.

### Distributed Ledger Systems
A system where data is stored across multiple locations or "nodes" to increase transparency and security. In this case, universities and foreign institutions act as nodes.

### Data Integrity and Security
Ensuring that academic records cannot be altered or falsified without detection. Blockchain offers an immutable record, while AI adds an additional layer of security through machine learning models.

### Speed of Access
With blockchain, access to academic transcripts is fast and secure, removing the delays caused by manual record-keeping.

### Forged Transcript Detection
AI techniques such as deep learning and anomaly detection are applied to identify potentially fraudulent academic records.

### Decentralized Systems
A system architecture where the control is distributed among various institutions (universities) rather than being managed by a central authority.
